Karuizawa 198428 Year Old Cocktail Series,"£8,000",,
Karuizawa 1981Sherry Cask #6056,"£9,500",,"An incredibly intense 1981 vintage bottling from cult closed Japanese distillery Karuizawa. Aged in a sherry cask for more than 30 years, this is another excellent example from this legendary distillery – it might just be the best one that we've bottled.Tasting Notes (1) "
Karuizawa 1984First Fill Sherry Cask #4021,"£9,500",,"Another enormously potent first fill sherry cask from Karuizawa, this was distilled in 1984 and displays very big earthy savoury notes, overcooked Dundee cake, leathery fruit and a hint of smoke. At 64.5% a drop of water (or four) is perfectly acceptable, but we actually preferred this one neat.Tasting Notes (1) "
Karuizawa 198429 Years Old Sherry Cask #3662,"£12,000",,"This sherry-matured Karuizawa was a joint bottling between The Whisky Exchange and Japanese company Shinanoya. Distilled in 1984 and aged for 29 years, 271 bottles were produced at 61%."
Karuizawa 30 Year OldBourbon Cask #8606,"£12,000",,"A contrast to its companion 31yo sherried release, this Karuizawa 30 year old has been matured solely in bourbon casks. A break from the distillery's usual character and one of only a handful of similar releases – intense and showing another side of this closed, cult distillery."
Karuizawa 35 Year OldBourbon Cask 8518 Emerald Geisha,"£18,000",5(2 Reviews),"Karuizawa's whiskies are legendary. Not only are they of sublime quality, but the distillery's closure almost 20 years ago means that they are rarer than emeralds. This exclusive single-cask bottling of 35-year-old single malt, created by Elixir Distillers, layers vanilla and spiced butter around the Karuizawa core.The distinctive emerald labels combine beautiful Japanese art forms with complex hot foil and intricate embossing embellishments, giving the bottles a sculptured finish. They were designed by The Whisky Exchange’s creative director Raj Chavda, who is also a fellow of the Royal Society of Art.Tasting Notes (1) "
Karuizawa 31 Year OldSapphire Geisha,"£19,000",,"A 31-year-old Karuizawa single malt, matured in a single sherry cask for more than three decades before being bottled by Elixir Distillers exclusively for The Whisky Exchange's Karuizawa Geishas series. The bottle features a label designed by our creative director Raj Chavda, paying homage to the exquisite, inaccessible beauty of the meiko on her way to become geisha.Tasting Notes (1) "

Karuizawa 29 Year OldBourbon Cask #8897,"£22,500",,"One of a pair of mirror-image labelled bottles released at The Whisky Exchange Whisky Show 2014. This is the bourbon-matured half of the duo, although its deep and rich colour is more reminiscent of a heavily sherried dram. This sold out during the weekend of The Whisky Show."
Karuizawa 196742 Year Old Cask #6426 TWE 10th Anniversary,"£22,500",,"Here it is - the legendary Karuizawa 1967 42yo from cask 6426. The oldest and most famous Karuizawa ever bottled when it appeared at the tail-end of 2009, we only ever had around 200 bottles of this one, and after Whiskyfun and Whiskynotes both gave it humungous 95 point scores, it sold out in a little over 24 hours.Tasting Notes (2) "
Hanyu 1990Queen of Hearts Cask #9102,"£25,000",,"One of a series of really terrific Japanese malts from the sadly now defunct Hanyu distillery. Bursting with character and complexity, these masterpieces from a 'lost' distillery are pricey, but well worth it. A massive hit at this year's Whisky Live.Tasting Notes (3) "
Karuizawa 38 Year OldPearl Geisha,"£25,000",,"Bottled by Elixir Distillers, this 38-year-old Karuizawa single malt is currently the oldest whisky in the prestigious Geisha series.One half of the exquisite Pearl Geisha duo, this was aged in sherry cask no. 4348 and filled into just 172 bottles at 62.1% ABV.The Geisha series was created to pay homage to both the exquisite whiskies of the closed Karuizawa distillery, and the majesty of its surrounding culture.

Karuizawa 30 Year OldSherry Cask #5347,"£25,000",,"The sherried half of a pair of Karuizawas launched at The Whisky Show 2014. Hugely popular, the tasting bottles were emptied in the first few minutes of each day of the show and the whisky sold out not long after. An intense, savoury and spicy whisky."
Karuizawa 36 Year OldSapphire Geisha,"£28,000",,"A 36-year-old Karuizawa single malt, matured in a single sherry cask for more than three decades before being bottled by Elixir Distillers exclusively for The Whisky Exchange's Karuizawa Geishas series.

Hanyu 1985 The JokerMonochrome Label,"£60,000",,"The last and final release from the Ichiro's Malt Card series bottlings from the closed Hanyu distillery. The Joker ""Monochrome"", perhaps is the rarest and most sought after from this legendary series."
